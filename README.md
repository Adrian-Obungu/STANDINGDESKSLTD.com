# **StandingDesk Project**

## Overview

**StandingDesk** is a project designed to provide an ergonomic and customizable standing desk solution that promotes healthy work habits and productivity. The platform offers users the ability to create and adjust standing desk setups tailored to their preferences, with real-time tracking of posture and usage patterns to ensure a balanced work routine.

This project involves a combination of hardware integration, software design, and user-centered interface development to provide a holistic standing desk experience.

## **Features**

- **Customizable Desk Heights**: Users can set personalized desk heights based on their preferences and body measurements.
- **Posture Tracking**: Monitors and suggests optimal postures through sensors (hardware integration) and alerts when users should adjust their desk height.
- **Activity Monitoring**: Tracks time spent sitting vs. standing and provides reminders to switch positions.
- **User Profile**: Allows users to create profiles that store desk setup preferences, posture data, and historical trends.
- **Mobile and Web Interface**: Accessible on both mobile and web platforms, ensuring users can control their standing desk setup remotely.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB for user profile management and data storage
- **Hardware Integration**: Arduino or Raspberry Pi for sensor integration to track desk height and posture
- **API**: RESTful API for communication between hardware and software
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS for user data backup and real-time synchronization
- **Mobile**: React Native for mobile app development
